1. Data organization
    The data is stored in the form of recordings in the .npy format and .txt files describing their content.
    For each colony "colony_name", you find both recordings and txt tiles in the folder /data/colony_name/recordings/
    Each txt file is a table that describe sounds that were detected in the corresponding recording.

    Importantly, there is a "recordings_metadata.csv" file that contains metadata (data, colony, rats involved etc.) of
    all recordings in the data storage. We also use this metadata file to track what processing steps were applied
    to each recording. This is represented by the "processing stage" column.

2. Notebooks

    The most important notebooks that can modify the data are stored in the /notebooks/process new data/ folder.
    First, to upload new recordings there is the upload_new_recordings.ipynb notebook. It takes recordings in .wav or
    .npy format from an external folder, moves them into the data storage and updates "recordings_metadata.csv".

    Then, there are two notebooks that update the txt files: "run_SoundSpliter.ipynb" and "run_classification.ipynb".
    The former detects the sounds in the recordings and adds them into the txt file, while the latter runs sound class
    classification and updates the "class" column in the txt file.

    The "run_SoftTrace.ipynb" notebook is responsible for computing traces of the sounds. Trace is a binary image in
    the time VS. frequency domain which we used to denoise some sounds (softchirps). Based on the notebook parameters,
    it takes particular sounds from a set of the recordings and computes traces for them. The traces are stored
    as images in the /data/colony_name/traces/ folder.
